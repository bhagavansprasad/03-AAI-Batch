Available tools:

1. GITHUB_ADD_AN_EMAIL_ADDRESS_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER
Adds one or more email addresses (which will be initially unverified) to the authenticated user's GitHub account; use this to associate new emails, noting an email verified for another account will error, while an existing email for the current user is accepted.

2. GITHUB_COMPARE_TWO_COMMITS
Compares two commit points (commits, branches, tags, or SHAs) within a repository or across forks, using `BASE...HEAD` or `OWNER:REF...OWNER:REF` format for the `basehead` parameter.

3. GITHUB_CREATE_A_BLOB
Creates a Git blob in a repository, requiring content and encoding ('utf-8' or 'base64'). Requires write access to the repository.

4. GITHUB_CREATE_A_PULL_REQUEST
Creates a pull request in a GitHub repository, requiring existing `base` and `head` branches; `title` or `issue` must be provided.

5. GITHUB_CREATE_A_REFERENCE
Creates a NEW Git reference (branch or tag) in a repository. IMPORTANT: This action ONLY creates NEW references - if the reference already exists, it will fail with a 422 'Reference already exists' error. To update an existing reference, use the 'Update a reference' (GITHUB_UPDATE_A_REFERENCE) action instead. The repository must not be empty prior to this operation.

6. GITHUB_CREATE_A_RELEASE
Creates a release in a GitHub repository for a specified tag; the tag must be unique for published releases, and if a `discussion_category_name` is given, it must already exist.

7. GITHUB_CREATE_A_TREE
Creates a new Git tree object in a repository, defining file/directory structure by specifying tree entries, optionally building on a `base_tree` SHA; all provided SHAs must be valid.

8. GITHUB_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FILE_CONTENTS
Creates a new file or updates an existing file in a GitHub repository; SHA can be provided to validate file updates, automatically fetched if not provided.

9. GITHUB_DELETE_A_REPOSITORY
Permanently deletes the specified repository; this is a destructive, irreversible action that requires admin privileges for the repository.

10. GITHUB_FIND_PULL_REQUESTS
Primary tool to find and search pull requests. Supports filtering by repository, author, state, labels, and merge status, and returns structured PR data for reliable use in workflows.

11. GITHUB_FIND_REPOSITORIES
AI-optimized repository search with smart filtering by language, stars, topics, and ownership. Builds intelligent search queries and returns clean, actionable repository data.

12. GITHUB_GET_A_BLOB
Retrieves the raw, typically Base64-encoded, content of a file (blob) from a GitHub repository using its SHA hash, if the repository and blob SHA exist.

13. GITHUB_GET_A_PULL_REQUEST
Retrieves a specific pull request from a GitHub repository using its owner, repository name, and pull request number.

14. GITHUB_GET_A_REFERENCE
Retrieves a specific Git reference (e.g., a branch, tag, or fully qualified like 'heads/main') from a GitHub repository. The reference must exist in the repository; use 'list_matching_references' first if unsure what references are available.

15. GITHUB_GET_A_TREE
Browse and list all files/directories in a GitHub repository. Efficiently retrieves the complete repository structure in a single API call when used with recursive mode. Perfect for analyzing codebase structure, finding specific files, or getting an overview of repository contents without cloning.

16. GITHUB_GET_RAW_REPOSITORY_CONTENT
Tool to fetch raw file content from a GitHub repository. Use when you need the raw bytes of a file in the repo.

17. GITHUB_GET_REPOSITORY_CONTENT
Retrieves a file's Base64 encoded content or lists a directory's contents from a GitHub repository.

18. GITHUB_LIST_BRANCHES
Lists branches for an existing GitHub repository, with an option to filter by protection status.

19. GITHUB_LIST_DEPLOYMENTS
Lists deployments for a specified repository; repository must exist.

20. GITHUB_LIST_ORGANIZATIONS_FOR_A_USER
Lists public organizations for a specified GitHub user; the `username` must be a valid GitHub handle.

21. GITHUB_LIST_ORGANIZATIONS_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER
Lists organizations the authenticated GitHub user is a member of, returning details for each organization.

22. GITHUB_LIST_PULL_REQUESTS
Lists pull requests for a GitHub repository. REQUIRES 'owner' AND 'repo' parameters - both are MANDATORY and must be provided in every call. Does NOT support filtering by assignee or date range - use GITHUB_FIND_PULL_REQUESTS instead for searching PRs by assignee, author, or across multiple repositories.

23. GITHUB_LIST_PULL_REQUESTS_FILES
Lists all files (including additions, modifications, and removals) associated with a specific pull request in a GitHub repository.

24. GITHUB_LIST_REPOSITORIES_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER
Lists repositories for the authenticated user; using 'type' with 'visibility' or 'affiliation' API parameters (not in this model) can cause a 422 error.

25. GITHUB_LIST_REPOSITORIES_STARRED_BY_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER
Lists repositories the authenticated user has starred, optionally sorted and paginated, including star creation timestamps via 'application/vnd.github.star+json' media type.

26. GITHUB_LIST_REPOSITORY_CONTRIBUTORS
Lists contributors to a specified repository, sorted by number of contributions in descending order; the repository must exist and be accessible.

27. GITHUB_LIST_REPOSITORY_ISSUES
Lists issues (including pull requests) from a GitHub repository. Requires BOTH 'owner' AND 'repo' parameters (e.g., owner='octocat', repo='Hello-World' for github.com/octocat/Hello-World).

28. GITHUB_LIST_STARGAZERS
Lists users who have starred the specified GitHub repository, which must exist.

29. GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER
Stars a specified repository (identified by owner and repo name) for the authenticated user; this action is idempotent and succeeds even if the repository is already starred. Requires explicit repository identification via owner and repo parameters.

30. GITHUB_UPDATE_A_REFERENCE
Updates an existing Git reference (e.g., a branch or tag) to point to a specific commit SHA. By default, only allows fast-forward updates (where the new commit is a descendant of the current one). Set `force=true` to allow non-fast-forward updates that rewrite history. IMPORTANT: The reference must already exist - use 'Create a reference' action to create new refs.
